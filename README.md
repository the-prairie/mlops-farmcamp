## Running example

To make it easier to connect different modules together, weâ€™d like to use the same running example throughout the course.

Possible candidates: 

* [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) - predict the ride duration or if the driver is going to be tipped or not

## FAQ

**I want to start preparing for the course. What can I do?**

If you haven't used Flask or Docker

* Check [Module 5](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/05-deployment) form ML Zoomcamp
* The [section about Docker](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/2_docker_sql) from Data Engineering Zoomcamp could also be useful

If you have no previous experience with ML

* Check [Module 1](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/01-intro) from ML Zoomcamp for an overview
* [Module 3](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/03-classification) will also be helpful if you want to learn Scikit-Learn (we'll use it in this course)
* We'll also use XGBoost. You don't have to know it well, but if you want to learn more about it, refer to [module 6](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/06-trees) of ML Zoomcamp
